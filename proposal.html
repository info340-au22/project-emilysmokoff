            <ol>
                <li>
                    For this project we are focusing on the topic of Environmental Sustainability. Environmental
                    sustainability is the responsibility to conserve natural resources and protect global ecosystems to
                    support health and wellbeing, now and in the future. Environmental Sustainability is fundamental to
                    the survival of the planet and human life. Consumers make decisions that affect our planet and are
                    often unaware of the ways in which these decisions negatively impact the environment.

                <li>
                    Some information problem questions we have identified in the field of Environmental Sustainability
                    are::
                    <ul>
                        <li> How might consumers be more aware of the environmental impacts of a product or service that
                        they are consuming?</li>
                        <li> How might consumers learn about sustainable product options available to them?
                        </li>
                        <li> How might consumers compare products and services in terms of environmental sustainability?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>While there have been a few existing solutions to address the lack of knowledge on which products
                    are sustainable and which are not, we found that there are gaps in past products. The best solution
                    we found was
                    <a href="https://www.ecofriendlyhabits.com/" target="_blank"><em>Eco Friendly Habits</em></a>.
                    This webpage allows you to be educated on how to be eco-friendly and
                    to see the top sustainable products for four areas: Fashion, Home and Living, Zero Waste, Cleaning,
                    and Beauty and Wellness.
                    However there is no way to search the sustainability of a certain product so it is more of a blog
                    that
                    teaches you how to be eco-friendly, and links out to their top chosen sustainable products. What we
                    want to build
                    is an application that allows you to see the sustainability of all products,
                    so you can learn whether the products you use are sustainable or not, and then have access to
                    eco-friendly options.

                <h2>App Description</h2>

            <h3>Users and Features</h3>
            <p> &nbsp; Our users will be anyone interested in the sustainability of products. As sustainable products
                tend to be
                more expensive, there will likely be a disparity in the demographic of our users. We anticipate that
                most of our users will be from high-income households because they are able to choose products for
                reasons other than price. Since income and other identities are correlated, our app will likely have a
                lower rate of users in minority groups, such as people of color. Additionally, since our app has an
                interactive map feature to locate a product in a store near them, users in rural areas will benefit less
                from our app. However, our app will link users to the store’s site, where they can purchase a product
                with delivery. Along with the map feature, users will be able to “bookmark,” or save products for later.
                This will allow users to come back to a product that interested them if they decide they would like to
                purchase it. If a user is looking for a specific product, they can search and filter for it to find the
                rating.
