                <li>While there have been a few existing solutions to address the lack of knowledge on which products
                are sustainable and which are not, we found that there are gaps in past products. The best solution we found was
                <a href="https://www.ecofriendlyhabits.com/" target="_blank"><em>Eco Friendly Habits</em></a>. 
                This webpage allows you to be educated on how to be eco-friendly and 
                to see the top sustainable products for four areas: Fashion, Home and Living, Zero Waste, Cleaning, and Beauty and Wellness. 
                However there is no way to search the sustainability of a certain product so it is more of a blog that 
                teaches you how to be eco-friendly, and links out to their top chosen sustainable products. What we want to build
                is an application that allows you to see the sustainability of all products,
                so you can learn whether the products you use are sustainable or not, and then have access to eco-friendly options.
