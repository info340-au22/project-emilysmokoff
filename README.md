# INFO 340 Project - Eco-Life by Group BA5

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

Our group is working on a website that revolves around sustainability. Specifically, being able to access information about the sustainability of all products, and request information about new products. We hope this solution can encourage everyone to use the cleanest and most sustainably products in their life.
